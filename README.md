  **Usage Notes**
  - The homepage will contain 4 buttons
  - The first button enables seeing and joining upcoming events
      - To join an event, need to click on the particular event item from the list
  - Admin may need to refresh the screen after deleting an event
      - After deleting, sometimes the event does not go away from the screen
      - You may need to delete twice or simple refresh/(go back and come back to the venue filter screen)
      - The error does not appear always and it took us a long time to even detect it

  **Github**
  - We were using another repo at the beginning but were uploading filed via upload
  - The link of that repo is given below so that the history of contributions can be noted
                https://github.com/jasonl-18/CSCB07_Project.git
  - During the second week, we created the current repo and have been using it in the traditional way from within android studio
      - The commits by @Farhan may be higher as I merged some code manually (contributed by other group members)
